# Simple Memo Application
## Used
- Koa + Apollo Server for Web Serving and XHR Requests
- Babel for transpile the client code
- Webpack
- Flow for static type check

## How to run
I'm still working on, currently you can only build client resources with npm start:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Make sure to run Koa server also!

```bash
$ node index
```
